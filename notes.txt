- order waiting list by sleep time (its easier to remove from the head!)
- no more tasks in ready/running (all tasks in waiting) -> idle task
- only actually execute each tick per 4 interrupts
- ticks decrement from waiting list and running list










TO-DO: 
- use .eqv for offsets
- add spaces to PCB and adjust program (TICKS_TO_SWITCH, TASK_PRIORITY, TASK_ID, TICKS_TO_WAIT




QUESTIONS:

- should i have a priority field in the PCB? how do i know what ready queue a task in waiting should go to?

- is the TICKS_TO_SWITCH PCB field the same as the sleep PCB field?
